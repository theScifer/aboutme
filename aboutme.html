        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>I'm a budding programmer. I'm a QA Analyst and am looking to gain the skills to become a Front-End Web Developer. I have a wife, two dogs, a turtle, and am currently excited about learning how to sail.</p>
        <p>My family and pets are important to me. I want to become a dev so I can better take care of all of us and I also like being creative - which this will allow me to be.</p>

        <h1>More About Me</h1>
        <h2>What are you favorite hobbies?</h2>
        <p>I soon hope that sailing will be a hobby, but I also love watching movies and I enjoy playing video games.</p>
        <h2>What's your dream job?</h2>
        <p>Right now I want to be a programmer. In the end I just want to have a career that I enjoy, allows me to tap into my creative side, and affords me the opportunity to do more in life, such as traveling.</p>
        <h2>What's your background?</h2>
        <p>I got my Bachelors in computer science with an emphasis in Networking. During this schooling I was introduced to programming but never particularly pursued it. I am now though! I've been learning online through different avenues how to create websites and am now getting serious by utilizing the Thinkful program! Which I'm very excited about.</p>
        <h2>What music have you been listening to lately?</h2>
        <p>There isn't any specific artist, but I've been listening to a lot of instrumental work as it is not distracting while I'm working. I also love a cappella music as I used to sing back in the day.</p>
